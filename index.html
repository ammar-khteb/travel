        <p id="par">Paris is one of my favourite cities!<br>
I’m so in love with its museums,<br> French cuisine and the vibe the city has.<br> I’m quite a lucky Paris is only <br>three hours away with a train from Amsterdam.<br> So, I’m there quite often.
However, <br>I was recently for the first time in Paris on a solo trip.<br> It was a mix of business and pleasure,<br> so I had enough time to enjoy in my short trip.<Br> Well, here is my travel diary with things I did during my three days in Paris.</p>

<p id="chanel"><strong>Palais Garnier and Coco Chanel
</strong>
<p>Palais Garnier and Coco Chanel
I took a walk from the Jardin du Luxembourg where my hotel was located towards the Seine River, Louvre and Palais Garnier.</p>
<img src="https://culturetourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/palais-garnier.jpg"width="500">

<p>I read<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1452104883/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=culturetour0e-21&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1452104883&linkId=f0b13f50955462127d2ef9ab7641552f"> Christina Henry de Tessan’s book </a> ‘Forever Paris’ before my trip. She has created a little self guided tours around Paris through which she’s following the footsteps of some famous people that used to live in Paris. I decided to follow the life of Coco Chanel. I’ve started my walk at the Opera Garnier and have continued walking through the neighbourhood. I’ve passed next to the first Chanel store, one of the apartments she used to live at and a place where she used to come for her morning coffee. There is something special in reading about someone’s life and walking along the streets where that person lived. Somehow, I could almost see her rushing through the small side streets from her apartment to the office with some new fashion drawings under her arm.</p>

<p id="Monet"><strong>Musée Marmottan Monet</strong>
</p>
<p> visited it a few years ago on a student trip with my University. And wanted to come back ever since. This is one of my favourite museums in Paris. It has a beautiful collection of one of the best female Impressionists – Berthe Morisot. And the largest collection of the works of Claude Monet. It’s not a busy museum, so there is a lot of space to enjoy in some of the masterpieces of Impressionism in peace and quiet. I’m always wondering why everyone is rushing to see Mona Lisa when in Paris, while there are is many beautiful museums around the city, like this one.

After this visit to Paris, I am even more in love with Impressionism than before. If the hygiene level were just a bit higher, I would love to live during that time. I would be an art dealer and will go to the little trips to nature to paint with the Monet and Renoir. Oh, those sweet dreams…</p>

<p>After the tour and a quick lunch, it was a time to catch a train back to Amsterdam. My two days in Paris were dedicated to art, mostly Impressionism and modern architecture. I also tried to learn more about some of its famous former citizens like Monet, Renoir, Cezanne and Coco Chanel.

<h4 id="London">London</h4>

<p id="lon">London is one of the most expensive cities in the world and whether you like it or not, you will most certainly need to part with your cash from time to time. There are also a number of public spaces to hangout, which of course are free; lovely parks and quiet, leafy squares that can provide havens of tranquility in the midst of this busy city..</p>
<p id="ss"><strong>Buckingham Palace</strong>
<img src="https://www.travelingchic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2_London.jpg"width="500">
<p>I booked an early ticket to Buckingham Palace (as we were told they could sell). Unfortunately, we could not take pictures inside, but it had everything to expect. The spacious rooms, magnificent chandeliers, beautiful paintings and beautiful gardens left nothing to be desired. I would highly recommend a visit. If you are not open when you are in town, visiting Windsor Castle is an excellent alternative. Buckingham Palace is a little bigger than Windsor, but both are a pleasant experience.</p>

<p>is a huge Ferris wheel located next to London aquarium and Big Ben. It is the largest Ferris wheel in the world. It’s about one hundred meters high and weighs approximately 1600 tons. It has got thirtytwo cabins and the ride goes on for about 30-40 minutes. The view from the top of the wheel was fantastic. I could see some of London’s other sightseeing spots like Big Ben and Buckingham Palace. Depending on the ticket you had bought, you could get a binocular and a guide who showed and featured most of the sights you could see from the London Eye.
